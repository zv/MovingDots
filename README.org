* Spirograph

  This repository generates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid][Epitrochoids]], curves traced by points on the perimeter of a circle which roll around an interior fixed circle. 
  
  Spirograph can also generate figures with an interior that is a square, triangle and other figures. Likewise, the curve traced can be one traced by a square moving about a circle (in addition to the better known circle moving about an interior circle).
  
  By default, it will demonstrate the different rates at which the outer circle can trace the interior, a new one each second, with it's rate shown in the upper right-hand corner.
